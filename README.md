I completed this project in R Markdown, which typically outputs to HTML. I included both of these files (.Rmd, .html) in the repository. To view the HTML
output in your web browser, click on the .html file and then hit the "download" button in the top right corner (in the same row as "Code" and "Blame," 
above "View Raw"). Then open the downloaded file.
